# SeniorProject
Goal of our Senior Project is to have an autonomous drone take data from a given area and create 3D models. 
Currently we are able to create monocular Depth Maps by using the MiDaS 2.1 model and use Open3D to convert them into pointclouds and 3d models.


Following libraries must be Installed: 
OpenCv
MatPlot
Pytorch
Open3d
NumPy

All our coding was done on Jupyter Notebook for easy visualization.

Running the code requires the following libraries, python, and Jupyter Notebook to run the old.ipynb.
